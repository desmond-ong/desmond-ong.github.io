                  Feb-Apr 2022: We had three papers recently accepted! 
                  The first, in <i>Social and Cognitive Neuroscience</i>, joint work with <a href="https://scholars.huji.ac.il/perrylab/people/shir-genzer">Shir Genzer</a>, <a href="https://scholars.huji.ac.il/perrylab">Anat Perry</a> and Jamil Zaki using EEG to study empathic accuracy. 
                  <br> The second in <i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>, a herculean effort led by <a href="https://www.amitgoldenberg.com/">Amit Goldenberg</a> and <a href="https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/jonas-schone">Jonas Sch&ouml;ne</a> on emotion perception of emotional expressions over time.
                  <br>
                  And the third, an intervention to for improving empathy in middle school, another years-long study led by Erika Weisz, will come out in <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i>.

Please register at the above link if you're interested to attend, as we have to account for social distancing requirements. <br> As CogSci is being held virtually this year, some members of CogSci proposed to organize local meetups, subject to local pandemic restrictions, as a chance for cognitive science researchers to present research in-person. Please also see <a href="https://cskemp.github.io/cogscimeetups21/index.html">this page</a> for more information about this initiative.
                  <br>

I hope everyone reading this stays safe as we come to the end of a very difficult year. And here's hoping that 2021 will be a much better year!

                  <b>Sep 2015</b>: Just to add to the recent debate on replicability in psychology, we (work with Jonathan Phillips, Mike C. Frank, Rebecca Saxe, and more!) have a replication paper that just came out in <i>Psychological Science</i>. We replicate the original paper's results, but show that the paradigm suffers from a flaw, and the original theory does not explain the results. I have lots of thoughts on this and on replicability in general, so feel free to hit me up if you wanted to discuss anything. More details (links to the papers and relevant blogposts) can be found on my research webpage.
