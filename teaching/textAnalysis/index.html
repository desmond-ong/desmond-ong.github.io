      <h4>University Catalog Course Description</h4>
      <p>
        People are generating enormous amounts of natural language data in today's digital society, ranging from social media and blogs to forums and product reviews, speeches and news stories. Such natural language text is written by people, and thus can provide insights into their psychology: how they feel about an issue, what kind of people they are, and even how they might behave. This course will introduce students to various methods of text analysis, with a focus on extracting psychological insights. In addition to learning a range of text analysis methods, we will also be discussing the underlying scientific basis that supports various use-cases. The course will be practical and involve substantial coding and implementation as part of homework assignments as well as a semester-long group project. Sample topics include: sentiment analysis, health, online misinformation. Sample Methods include: word-count methods such as sentiment lexicons and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (developed here at UT!); statistical natural language processing tools (e.g., nltk); deep-learning-based Large Language Models (LLMs).
      </p>


      <h4> Learning Objectives </h4>
        <p>
        By the end of the course:
        <ul>
          <li> Students will be able to appreciate the underlying theoretical basis for extracting psychological insights from text. </li>
          <li> Students will be familiar with and able to execute various text analysis methods.  </li>
          <li> Students will apply the concepts learnt in class in a class project on text analysis. </li>
        </ul> 
        </p>

      <h4> Academic Integrity </h4>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Plagiarism is unacceptable</b>. If we find any evidence of plagiarism (for example, copying text wholesale from a website, an academic paper, or another source without proper citation) or any other forms of academic dishonesty (for example, cheating on a quiz), you will receive a zero, and you may face disciplinary action by the university. 
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Exceptions: You may use portions of your Project Proposal in your Final Report, i.e., within the class (and you can do this without citing your Proposal).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li> 
            But: you may not use portions of any of your previous work outside this class (previous class papers; previous or current research projects) without the prior approval of the instructor. 
          </li>
          <li> 
            Note that this also applies to code that you write. I'm a big fan of open-source code and will recommend several open-sourced resources throughout the course, but you should still cite your sources, especially if you modified or adapted a complex piece of code. If it forms a big part of your project, I expect citation in the project writeup. Otherwise, commented citations in your code will suffice. Merely citing does not license you to use copyrighted material, so do not use any copyrighted or proprietary software without appropriate permission. If in doubt, ask the instructor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        In short: don’t steal, and cite your sources, especially if you borrow or are otherwise influenced by ideas, text, or code. 
        References and citation should be done in APA format.

      </a>
      <p>
        The class group project offers you an opportunity to coalesce all that you have learnt and apply it in a project of your choice. You would have to do a proper literature review, come up with research questions, obtain access to data, apply or modify a method learnt in class, analyze the results, and discuss the inferences.


        <!-- The class project offers you an opportunity to apply what you have learnt in the class. The final outcome will vary depending on the choice of project, but will involve a substantial amount of research and/or development. Projects can take many forms, such as ... -->
        <!-- the incorporation of emotion recognition into a prototype software system or app, a research project implementing the latest techniques in machine learning to affective computing, a critical evaluation of an existing technology offering that might also include a discussion of how a particular technology is implemented and their ethical ramifications.  -->
        <!-- <br><br> -->
        <!-- Students are expected to do a substantial amount of the background reading of the emotion literature in order to inform the project, or do critical research on existing technologies. You must base your project on compelling scientific prior work. Even if you decide to build something completely new that has not been studied before, there must be related work that will inform your proposed project.  -->
        <!-- <br><br>
        The scope is open-ended, and you and your group members will come to a consensus as to a feasible (and mutually agreeable) project. 
        Unless students opt-out, final project write-ups (and any associated demos/material) will be made publically available and archived on the course webpage.
         -->
        <br><br>
        More information will be provided in class.
        <!-- <br><br> -->
        <!-- We assume that students (being final-year undergrads in a School of Computing) will be familiar with good coding practices, such as using version control. We expect that students will make all their final project code available via a public GitHub respoitory. Please get familiar with GitHub and version control if you are not already, and consider looking into requesting an education account at <a href="https://education.github.com/">https://education.github.com/</a>, which among other things, allows you to have private repositories (which some students may be more comfortable with for works-in-progress). -->
        <!-- <br><br>
        If you are using data (and most of the projects will), please bear in mind any restrictions about publically sharing the data. In the majority of cases, I recommend to <b>only commit CODE</b> to GitHub, and <b>not to commit any data</b> unless you have obtained the necessary permissions from the data owners or other relevant parties. When in doubt, ask the instructor. (Do not even commit data to a private repository, because you might make it public in the future). -->
