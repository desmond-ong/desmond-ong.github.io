           <!-- Preamble -->
          <p>
            I am broadly interested in how people understand the <i>emotions</i> and other <i>mental states</i> of those around them (Affective and Social Cognition). I study this by building <b>computational cognitive models of reasoning</b>. That is, I investigate how people intuitively reason about those around them, and try to codify such reasoning using computational models (usually, via probabilistic approaches). Computational cognitive modeling (i) allows researchers to specify and test precise, quantitative hypotheses about cognition and affect, and (ii) opens the doors to many applications, such as enabling computers to "reason" about emotions and mental states in a human-like manner.
          
            <br><br>

            In my work, I take an interdisciplinary approach, theoretically grounded in cognitive science and affective science, along with tools from computer science (<b>probabilistic modeling and probabilistic programming</b>; machine learning; natural language processing; social network analyses) and behavioral economics (economic games and analyses). I also apply modeling to study empathy, Theory of Mind, and prosocial behavior, among others.

            <br><br>
            
            In addition to cognitive science research, I also explore many applications of the modeling work that I do. I am interested in two main areas of applications: <b>applications to technology</b> (e.g., affective computing and affective robotics), and <b>applications to clinical contexts</b> (e.g., building models of affective and social dysfunction).

              Understanding how humans reason about emotions and mental states lets us build computational models and artificial intelligence that can similarly reason about emotions and mental states (right arrow). Furthermore, having better computational models will allow us to ask more precise questions about the nature of human cognition (left arrow). This results in a virtuous cycle where scientific progress in psychology fuels progress in artificial intelligence which in turn fuels more progress in psychology.

            Affective Cognition
          </h3>
          <p>
            When we see someone miss a bus, receive a present, or walk with a skip in their step, we have no difficulty inferring their emotions, their thoughts, and even what they might do next. The ability to effortlessly perform such reasoning, <b>Affective Cognition</b> (reasoning about affect), is crucial to our everyday lives.
            <br><br>
            Underpinning affective cognition is a set of rich knowledge about emotions, encapsulated in laypeople's <i>intuitive theories</i> of emotion. That is, in people's minds, what are emotions? What causes emotions? What do emotions cause people to do?
            <br><br>
            I take a probabilistic approach by modeling people's intuitive theories as generative, causal models (i.e., using Bayesian Networks and other similar models). Under this framework, laypeople's intuitive reasoning about emotions can be described by (Bayesian) inference within these causal models.
            (See <a href="research_affCog.html">here</a> for a more detailed writeup.)
            <br><br>
            I use a variety of different approaches to address these questions (and much more!) in a variety of different contexts:
            <ul>
              <li> I study the cues (facial expressions, prosody, as well as contextual cues) that people use when reasoning about others. </li>
              <li> I study reasoning across many different contexts: reasoning about "near-misses", reasoning about others across psychological distance, reasoning about emotion-driven actions, etc.</li>
              <li> I study how children acquire such rich knowledge about emotions. </li>
              <li> I study how such reasoning may be impacted by affective disorders. </li>
            </ul>
            My projects on affective cognition are also closely related to the next set of projects on empathic accuracy; they are distinct research questions but my work in one often informs the other.

          <h3>Empathic Accuracy</h3>
          <p>
            When people reason about the emotions of those around them, are they actually accurate? Or perhaps, are there systematic biases in the way that people interpret different types of information when inferring the emotions of those around them? What are the computational, psychological, and neural bases underlying accurate emotion judgments?
            <br><br>
            In this set of projects, we are interested in people's accuracy in evaluating the emotions of those around them. My collaborators and I investigate empathic accuracy using challenging, naturalistic contexts. To this end, I use tools from computer science to extract features from videos (e.g., acoustic features, linguistic features) and examine how people use these features in making their judgments. This involves acoustic processing, natural language processing, as well as time-series probabilistic modeling.
            <br><br>
            In addition to computational modeling, we also study empathic accuracy (i) with neuroscientific approaches (fMRI, EEG), (ii) across demographic groups and across cultures, and (iii) in populations with mood disorders.

            As they say, "No man is an island". People naturally turn to others in their social network for companionship and social support, in both good times and bad. When important life events happen, who do people turn to, and when is the provided social support effective?
            <br><br>
            I use social network analyses to look at how people navigate their social networks, and how emotions, empathy, and social support propagate within both in-person and online social networks. I also combine network analysis with other approaches (like analyzing natural language text) to examine how social interactions contribute to social support within the network.
