                  July 2021: <a href="https://desmond-ong.github.io/cogscimeetups21-sg/">Singapore CogSci Meetup on Tuesday 27th July, at NUS Campus</a>! Please register at the above link if you're interested to attend, as we have to account for social distancing requirements. <br> As CogSci is being held virtually this year, some members of CogSci proposed to organize local meetups, subject to local pandemic restrictions, as a chance for cognitive science researchers to present research in-person. Please also see <a href="https://cskemp.github.io/cogscimeetups21/index.html">this page</a> for more information about this initiative.

              I am a cognitive scientist interested in how people (and computers) reason about other people: how they think and what they feel. 
              <br><br>
              I am an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/disa/bio/dongch//">Information Systems and Analytics</a> within the <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/">School of Computing</a> at the <a href="https://nus.edu.sg">National University of Singapore</a>, where I lead a team of talented researchers in the <a href="https://cascoglab.github.io">Computational Affective and Social Cognition Lab</a>.

              I earned my Ph.D. in Psychology and a Master's degree in Computer Science from Stanford University.

              Broadly, my interests fall into the field of <b>Affective Cognition</b>, or how people reason about emotions, both our own and those of other people (i.e., cognition <i>about</i> affect). In my work, I seek to understand such reasoning by building formal computational <a href="research_affCog.html">models</a> of affective cognition.
                <br> <br>
              I'm also interested in a broad range of topics including: empathy, social   cognition, and theory of mind; prosocial behavior; data analytic methods; artificial intelligence; and behavioral economics. -->

                  <b>Sep 2015</b>: Just to add to the recent debate on replicability in psychology, we (work with Jonathan Phillips, Mike C. Frank, Rebecca Saxe, and more!) have a replication paper that just came out in <i>Psychological Science</i>. We replicate the original paper's results, but show that the paradigm suffers from a flaw, and the original theory does not explain the results. I have lots of thoughts on this and on replicability in general, so feel free to hit me up if you wanted to discuss anything. More details (links to the papers and relevant blogposts) can be found on my research webpage.
